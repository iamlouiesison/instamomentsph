# Quick Development Fix - Disable Email Confirmation

## Temporary Solution for Development

If you need to continue development immediately while setting up proper email:

### Option 1: Disable Email Confirmation in Supabase
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Authentication → Settings → Email Templates
3. Toggle OFF "Enable email confirmations"
4. This allows users to sign up without email verification

### Option 2: Use Real Email for Testing
- Use your own email address for testing
- Create a test Gmail account specifically for development
- Avoid using obviously fake emails

### Option 3: Use Supabase's Test Mode
1. In Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Settings
2. Enable "Enable email confirmations" 
3. But use real email addresses for testing

## Important Notes
- This is only for development
- Always set up proper email for production
- Monitor bounce rates to avoid future restrictions
- Use the Resend setup guide for production

## Next Steps
1. Set up Resend email provider (recommended)
2. Configure custom SMTP in Supabase
3. Test with real email addresses
4. Monitor email delivery rates
