# Project Ideas

## What is this?

**InstaMoments** - A PWA (Progressive Web App) that creates instant collaborative photo and video galleries for events. Attendees scan a QR code, which opens their device camera in the browser, capture moments, add personal messages, and contribute to a shared real-time event album that everyone can view and interact with. Optional video greetings feature allows users to record personal 20-second messages for complete event memories.

## Who is this for?

**Event organizers across all verticals in the Philippines:**

- Wedding couples and wedding planners
- Corporate event managers and HR teams
- Party hosts (birthdays, debuts, anniversaries, celebrations)
- Conference and meetup organizers
- Festival and community event coordinators
- Barangay and community celebration organizers
- Family reunion hosts
- Graduation ceremony organizers
- Corporate team building coordinators
- Anyone hosting gatherings who wants to capture all the candid moments AND personal messages

## What problem does it solve?

Photo and video sharing at Filipino events is completely broken:

- **Guests forget to share photos** after long celebrations end
- **Hosts miss candid moments** they weren't present for during busy events
- **Photos are scattered everywhere** - Facebook, Viber groups, individual phones, messaging apps
- **Video messages get lost** in different platforms and group chats
- **No easy central collection** - memories stay fragmented across devices
- **Quality is lost** through messaging apps and social media compression
- **App download friction** prevents participation from all attendees
- **Personal video greetings** are difficult to organize and collect
- **Event memories fade** because photos and videos never get properly organized or shared
